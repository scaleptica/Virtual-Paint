# Virtual-Paint
In this project the user can virtually paint on the realtime webcam frame, without physical contact with the keyboard, all the user has to do is wave the colored object in front of the webcam, and the painting will be displayed on the screen. So necessarily one can say that your surroundings is your canvas. You can choose different colors and draw in the air for it to be displayed on the monitor.
In this project however, masks of only two colors have been provided, namely green and blue. More masks of different colors can be added using the WebCam
