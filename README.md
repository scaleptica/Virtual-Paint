# Virtual-Paint
In this project the user can virtually paint on the webcam frames in real time, without physical contact with the keyboard, all the user has to do is wave the colored object in front of the webcam, and the painting will be displayed on the screen. So necessarily one can say that your surroundings is your canvas.
You can choose different colors and draw in the air for it to be displayed on the monitor. In this project however, masks of only two colors have been provided, namely green and blue. More masks of different colors can be added using the WebCam_maskCreator file provided with the project.
Using that file, one can estimate the maximum and minimum values of the "Hue, Saturation and Value" of any specific color through trackbars.
